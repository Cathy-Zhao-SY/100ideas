**Who will benefit most from this technology and who will be disadvantaged most? Write two speculative diary entries from the point of views of someone from each group. These should focus on the day to day personal life of these hypothetical individuals but should clearly illustrate what it might be like in the future for this person to live in a world with this particular technology.**

Film industry will get benefit from this technology since XR can help dead actors show up on the screen again. For instance, probably after 5 years, people can watch films that are all casted by passed away actors or actresses.
Also, I think people who miss their passed away relatives can use this technology to see their relatives once again. They can probably use home theatre to watch the memory that could probably create if they were still alive. Probably in the future, people can make XR videos by their own without professional help.

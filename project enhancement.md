**My main focus will be: 3D Model in Game & 3D Virtual**

Briefly explain the main idea behind the idea/technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?
	- 3D model:3D model is a technique by using computers to create 3D models that can be used in different platforms. It can be used for games, movies, and artworks. It is usually created through softwares.
	- XR: This technique is by using the data of a human such as memories and analyze it, in order to create a XR character on the screen. This can be used in films, and some memeorable dead actors or actresses can be on the screen again due to this technique. It makes digital version of that human.

Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this idea/technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.
	- 3D model: Ubisoft Montreal. This game company uses high technology to approach the reality. This company has already made a lot of games, and it even made a 3D model of BBC reporter for the interview. 
	- XR: Travis Cloyd, CEO of Worldwide XR, who is leading the design on the Dean project. He is trying to bring James Dean back to the screen. He is one of the leaders of this project and I think this project is related on what I research.
   	  Worldwide XR: "WXR combines creative vision, XR technology, and our unique partnership with the licensing powerhouse CMG Worldwide to develop unique virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality solutions for clients of all backgrounds."

What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?
	- 3D model: 1960. Because people pay attention to 3D modeling.
	- XR: in 1957, people were curious about virtual reality so they created a booth for enjoy. In 2017, scientists finally created VR for gaming.
    
create a mind-map of connections between the technology you are researching and other related technology. This could include sub-categories within your research area and/or technological predecessors and/or technology which is otherwise related to your area... for example:## A New Post
I will graph it on paper.

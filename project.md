1. 3D Virtual
Replacing dead actors in movies by using the historical images, audios, and materials to create the awareness on screens. It can deliver new scenes to audience and brings up new videos for people who love them. It is not creating a brand new person, but using the data to make dead actors on screens again.

2. Robotic Animal
Robotic animal is used for treating patients with mental illness. It can react based on what human does. I think it is helping people since robotic animal will not die and it can be fixed once it has problems while real dogs probably need to be trained for a long time to match with the high demand. Using robotic animal can also decrease the cost comparing with having a real dog.

3. 3D Model in Game
People in real life can be put into games just as Watch Dogs. Just as the video shows, the interviewer's facial expression and details are captured, and the facial movements are also captured by multiple cameras and high technology things. I think it is interesting because gamers can engage with real life events in games, especially for gamers who are not satisfied with the government and think they can do better, they can have a chance to change the society in the game.

4. Data
Collecting data based on what users search, view, and use to generate analysis of that specific users in order to recommend things that the users are probably interested in, just as Instagram and Tiktok, is something I am interested in since I watched a drama called Person in Interest, and I think data is related with human tightly since our privacy is related with these social medias or online shopping apps.

5. Holoportation Booth
3D images are in the booth which gives the audience a real impression that the characters are standing beside them. Also, the booth can create reflection at the background when the characters turn around. The audience can interact with them while standing in front of them.
